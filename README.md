Atbcore Library
=======

A pure and powerful JavaScript Atbcore library.

## Principles

ATBcoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the ATBcoin network allows for highly resilient atbcoin infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement atbcoin apps and services.

## Get Started

```
npm install atbcore-lib
```

## Security

We're using Atbcore in production, as are many others, but please use common sense when doing anything related to finances! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions.

If you find a security issue, please email segwitcoin@gmail.com.
